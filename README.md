# electronicparts-network
This is an example of a blockchain hyperledger fabric business network for electronic parts.  
The purpose of this low-resolution prototype business network and chaincode is to illustrate how blockchain could help detect and prevent counterfeit electronic parts by using a shared, permissioned, immutable ledger to record the pedigree of electronic parts throughout its lifecycle.
To use this business network, deploy the electronicpart.bna file to an instance of a running Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.
